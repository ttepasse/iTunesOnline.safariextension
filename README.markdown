# Fuck iTunes Previews

Once upon a time Tobias Tom made a [Safari Extension](http://tobiastom.github.com/iTunesOnline.safariextension) which blocks the automatic opening of iTunes when visiting iTunes Store preview web pages. Sadly it stopped working.

So I salvaged it and tried with cursory reading of Appleâ€™s JS to find another way. The query parameter `ls=1` seems to do the trick. Also I gave it a better name.
